backdoor
========

A Backdoor Terminal in C and Ruby.

The Backdoor should be initialized by a port knocking sequence from the Attacker machine. A sniffer application should be used to sniff the port knock sequence. If the port knock sequence was successful, the backdoor application should initialized. This applicatio nshould produce the least amount of traffic and leave the least amount of footprint possible.
